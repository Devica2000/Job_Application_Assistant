**Subject: Seeking Your Insights on Machine Learning Engineer Role at Reddit**

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Devica Verma, and I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Vegas.com, where I have been responsible for designing and building end-to-end machine learning systems at scale. I recently came across the Machine Learning Engineer, Core Ranking position at Reddit and am very excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

With a Master's in Computer Science from Columbia University, specializing in Machine Learning, and hands-on experience with Python, SQL, TensorFlow, and AWS, I have developed a strong foundation in building and deploying sophisticated machine learning models. In my current role, I have successfully led projects that significantly improved user engagement and conversion rates through advanced ranking systems and A/B testing.

I am particularly drawn to this role at Reddit because of my passion for building delightful products that enhance user experiences, as well as my experience with recommender systems and ranking models. Additionally, I am excited about the collaborative environment at Reddit and the opportunity to work with a team that handles billions of events and terabytes of data daily.

I would love to connect with you for a brief chat or coffee (virtual works too!) to learn more about the Core Ranking ML team and discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can contribute to Reddit's mission. If referrals are possible, I would greatly appreciate any guidance you can offer.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of connecting with you.

Best regards,
Devica Verma
